# SBOMit

SBOMit is a supply-chain security framework that generates accurate SBOMs directly from in-toto attestations, ensuring that component inventories reflect the real dependencies used during the build process. SBOMit leverages the [witness](https://github.com/in-toto/witness) tool to capture build-time filesystem, process, and execution events, and converts these authenticated provenance records into a complete, verifiable SBOM.

In addition to filesystem and process tracing, SBOMit includes network tracking to observe outbound connections and capture dynamically downloaded build-time dependencies. This ensures that transient or runtime-fetched components are not missed by traditional SBOM tools.

SBOMit outputs a cryptographically verifiable SBOM enriched with:

1. **Build-Time Dependency Discovery**
Extracted from witness attestations, including files read/written, processes executed, and dynamically generated artifacts.

2. **Network-Based Dependency Capture**
Mapping network requests to dependency sources (e.g., Cargo crates, pip packages, OS packages) to detect ephemeral dependencies not captured statically.

3. **Provenance-Backed Integrity**
Every SBOM element is derived from authenticated in-toto attestations, enabling downstream verification, reproducibility analysis, and policy enforcement.
